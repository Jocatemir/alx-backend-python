# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Async comprehension is a feature in Python that allows developers to write asynchronous code that can be executed concurrently.

## An asynchronous comprehension is similar to a list comprehension, but it is used with an asynchronous generator or an asynchronous iterator. It allows you to create a list, set, or dictionary of items asynchronously.
