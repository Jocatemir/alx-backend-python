# 0x01-python_async_function

## In Python, we can write code in a special way to make it asynchronous, that is do multiple tasks at the same time.In Python, we use a special keyword called async to mark certain functions or blocks of code as asynchronous. This tells Python that these parts can be executed in an asynchronous manner. We can also use the await keyword to ask the robot to wait for a task to finish before moving on to the next one.

## By writing code in an asynchronous way, we can make our programs faster and more efficient. It's like having a super-fast robot that can do many things at once, making our programs more responsive and allowing us to get things done more quickly.
